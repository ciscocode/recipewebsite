        <h3>List of Ingredients:</h3>
        <div class=align-center>
            <ul>
                <li>About 3/4 to 1 cup extra virgin olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil, more or less depending on how many chips you are making</li>
                <li>Corn tortillas (get the standard kind, not the super fancy kind), each tortilla will make 6 chips, 12 tortillas will yield 72 chips, a good snack for 2 to 3 people</li>
                <li>Kosher Salt (or other coarse salt)</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dry the tortillas in the oven:</strong>
                    <p>The tortilla chips will fry better if they are a bit dried out first. Either leave the whole tortillas out overnight, exposed to air so they are stale the next day, or dry them out a bit in the oven or microwave.</p>
                    <p>To dry them in the oven, lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet and put them in a 350°F for 5 minutes or a 200°F oven for 10 minutes.</p>
                </li> 
                
                <li><strong>Cut each tortilla into 6 triangle shaped wedges:</strong>

                </li>
                
    
                <li><strong>Heat the oil in the pan:</strong>
                    <p>Pour oil into a medium skillet to a depth of 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch. (Make sure you are working with a completely dry pan or the oil will sputter as it heats.)</p>
                    <p>Heat the oil on medium high heat until a small piece of tortilla placed in the oil sizzles, about 350°F. (This is where an <a class="text" href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&jsonp=vglnk_159103504535215&key=8706c34907fb807707a11c5a8d2786cd&libId=kasuqi0j0102elqz000DAnva6lmh1&loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplyrecipes.com%2Frecipes%2Fhow_to_make_homemade_tortilla_chips%2F&v=1&out=https%3A%2F%2Faax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com%2Fx%2Fc%2FQj_SmeGr1UfB9fiLCgGjODUAAAFyYtFG9gEAAAFKAXDPliQ%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%2F%3FimprToken%3De7ZIZjIvtq2aR-vKjcnocQ%26slotNum%3D0%26_encoding%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D390957%26field-keywords%3Dinfrared%2520thermometer%26linkCode%3Dur2%26tag%3Dsimplyrecip02-20%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplyrecipes.com%2Frecipes%2Ftype%2Fquick%2F&title=How%20to%20Make%20Homemade%20Tortilla%20Chips%20%7C%20SimplyRecipes.com&txt=infrared%20thermometer" target=_blank>infrared thermometer</a> 
                    comes in handy!) If a small tester piece of tortilla browns too quickly, the oil is too hot. Remove the pan from heat to let the oil cool a bit before continuing.</p>
                </li> 
    
    
                <li><strong>Fry the tortilla chips:</strong>
                    <p>Place a paper towel onto a large plate and have several other paper towels ready. Place a handful of tortilla triangles into the hot oil, in a single layer.
                    Use metal tongs or a metal slotted spoon to distribute the tortilla triangles so that they aren't overlapping and so that all sides get coated with oil.
                    Fry for approximately 2 minutes until the chips just begin to color and they are firm, no longer pliable.</p>

                </li> 
                
                <li><strong>Move chips to a paper-towel-lined plate:</strong>
                    <p>Use tongs or a slotted spoon remove the chips from the oil to the paper-towel-lined plate.
                    Sprinkle with salt.
                    Place another paper towel over the top of the chips to be ready for the next batch.</p>

                    <p>Note that as soon as you put the tortilla triangles into the hot oil, because you are working with such a small volume of oil, the oil temperature will lower. Usually I compensate for this by increasing the heat to high. And as soon as the chips begin to color, I reduce the heat to low, so the oil doesn't overheat in between batches of chips.</p>
                    <p>Continue to cook the chips, working in batches, placing the freshly fried chips over a new layer of paper towel each time, and sprinkling with salt.
                    When the chips are all fried, pat any excess oil from them with a fresh paper towel, and eat! These chips are best freshly made.</p>
